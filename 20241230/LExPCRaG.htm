    <h1>Class Rules and Regulations</h1>

    <button class="accordion">Attention Protocol</button>
    <div class="panel"><p>Stand at attention when I enter the room. You will also be instructed to stand at attention when a higher-ranking individual arrives. Upon the command “Attention!”, immediately stop what you are doing, face me, and listen.</p></div>

    <button class="accordion">Cheating</button>
    <div class="panel"><p>Cheating is strictly prohibited. If caught, your paper will be confiscated, and you will be referred to the disciplinary officer.</p></div>

    <button class="accordion">Class Mayor</button>
    <div class="panel"><p>A class mayor will be elected to maintain order, relay concerns, and ensure the classroom is clean before dismissal.</p></div>

    <button class="accordion">Excused Absences</button>
    <div class="panel"><p>All excused absences must be supported with valid documentation and presented on the next class you attend. Acceptable excuses include illness (with a medical certificate) or the death of an immediate family member (with a copy of the death certificate).</p></div>

    <button class="accordion">Following Instructions</button>
    <div class="panel"><p>Read and follow instructions thoroughly. Stay alert for both verbal and non-verbal cues from the instructor.</p></div>

    <button class="accordion">General Conduct</button>
    <div class="panel"><p>Maintain a clean workspace. Properly dispose of waste. Follow all safety and emergency procedures, and observe health protocols when applicable.</p></div>

    <button class="accordion">Grades</button>
    <div class="panel"><p>You may visit during consultation hours to inquire about your grades. Requests for grade rectification will only be entertained before the final exam. Present relevant proof such as returned assignments, quizzes, or lab work.</p></div>

    <button class="accordion">Group Work</button>
    <div class="panel"><p>Group collaboration is a shared responsibility. Cooperate actively. Group performance will be evaluated.</p></div>

    <button class="accordion">Laboratory Rules</button>
    <div class="panel"><p>No horseplay. Handle instruments with care. Speak quietly. Always bring the required protective equipment and follow instructions diligently. Safety is a priority.</p></div>

    <button class="accordion">Lecture Procedures (Face-to-Face)</button>
    <div class="panel"><p>Expect an assessment during every meeting. Half the items will count as a quiz; the other half as recitation. Bring your recitation card, 0.25 sheet of yellow paper, and a black pen every session.</p></div>

    <button class="accordion">Online Class Guidelines</button>
    <div class="panel"><p>You are required to turn on your camera and be ready to unmute when called. Join our Discord server during scheduled class time. If I do not arrive within 10 minutes, you may leave. Our online sessions are divided into three: (1) discussion/instructions, (2) activity, and (3) reading.</p></div>

    <button class="accordion">Silence</button>
    <div class="panel"><p>Maintain silence during class. Refrain from talking to classmates unless instructed. Communicate only with the instructor. Move quietly. Only involuntary sounds such as sneezing or coughing are excused.</p></div>

    <button class="accordion">Standards and Formats</button>
    <div class="panel"><p>Always follow the given format. Include your name and date on all submissions unless otherwise instructed.</p></div>

    <button class="accordion">Use of Devices</button>
    <div class="panel"><p>Put devices on silent mode. Smartphones are only allowed during emergencies or for verified course-related searches. You may verify class information online if needed.</p></div>
